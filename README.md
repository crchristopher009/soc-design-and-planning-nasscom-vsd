# Section 1 - Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK
## Lab Session 1
Section 1 tasks:-
1. Run 'picorv32a' design synthesis using OpenLANE flow and generate necessary outputs.
2. Calculate the flop ratio.
   
   Flop Ratio = (Number of D Flip-Flops) / (Total Number of Cells)
   Percentage of DFFs = Flop Ratio * 100
