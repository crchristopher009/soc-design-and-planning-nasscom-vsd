# Section 1 - Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK
## Lab Session 1
Section 1 tasks:-
1. Run 'picorv32a' design synthesis using OpenLANE flow and generate necessary outputs.
2. Calculate the flop ratio.
   
   Flop Ratio = (Number of D Flip-Flops) / (Total Number of Cells)
   
   Percentage of DFFs = Flop Ratio * 100
   
1. Run 'picorv32a' design synthesis using OpenLANE flow and generate necessary outputs.
Commands to invoke the OpenLANE flow and perform synthesis
    
         # Change directory to openlane flow directory
         cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane
         # alias docker='docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) efabless/openlane:v0.21'
         # Since we have aliased the long command to 'docker' we can invoke the OpenLANE flow docker sub-system by just running this command
         docker
   
         # Now that we have entered the OpenLANE flow contained docker sub-system we can invoke the OpenLANE flow in the Interactive mode using the following command
         ./flow.tcl -interactive

         # Now that OpenLANE flow is open we have to input the required packages for proper functionality of the OpenLANE flow
         package require openlane 0.9

         # Now the OpenLANE flow is ready to run any design and initially we have to prep the design creating some necessary files and directories for running a specific design which in our case is 'picorv32a'
         prep -design picorv32a

         # Now that the design is prepped and ready, we can run synthesis using following command
         run_synthesis

         # Exit from OpenLANE flow
         exit

         # Exit from OpenLANE flow docker sub-system
         exit
